[{"categories":"Articles","content":"About The purpose of this article is to explain the backed of this website, and my ratinal behind the way it is. I hope this offers some insight.\nHosting Both sites is hosted on Github pages. Why? the awnser is very very simple. It is Free. and easy to edit from anywhere. this can cause some security risks but as I am not housing any sensitive data then its fine. This Website is acctually two websites, as it is two diffrent github repos. The first houses the main site and all its content. The second houses this Hugo site that you are currently reading this article on right now.\nWhy two repos I initially just had the main site and had all the articles linked off of it, but when it came time to make new articles, it began to become very tidious to code all of the html and css for the page that I was not motivated to accually write anything. Also I wanted some of my firends to write some areticles for my website and Learning Markdown Is a signifiganly lower barrier of entry.\nThe Actual Code The majority of the site is coded in Html, obviously, as that is the only thing github pages supports. But I have heabily used js and css to enhance the site, besides the links page (If you want to know why to read the explaination there). All of the css and js are in external files so that I can resue them esily between Pages.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/about/","tags":"Articles, Author: Eli Watson","title":"How This Website Works"},{"categories":"Projects","content":"So I had this old Dell E5410 that was just sitting on a shelf collecting dust.

This article delves into the intricacies of multistage coilguns, exploring the necessary components, principles, and applications of this technology.\nMultistage Coilgun A multistage coilgun is a sophisticated electromagnetic launcher comprised of multiple coil stages arranged along a barrel. Each stage contributes to the acceleration of the projectile, resulting in significant velocity gains over the length of the barrel. The design of a multistage coilgun requires careful consideration of coil geometry, timing, and power distribution to optimize performance. The key challenge in multistage coilgun design lies in efficiently transferring momentum to the projectile without prematurely decelerating it. To address this, precise control of the switching circuitry is essential. By deactivating each coil stage before the projectile reaches the center of the coil, the magnetic forces can be utilized to propel the projectile forward.\nSwitching Circuitry Switching circuitry plays a crucial role in the operation of a coilgun, ensuring precise timing and control over the magnetic forces acting on the projectile. MOSFETs (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors) are commonly employed for high-voltage switching applications due to their fast switching speed and low on-resistance. In a multistage coilgun, the switching circuitry coordinates the activation and deactivation of each coil stage as the projectile traverses the barrel. Timing is critical to ensure that the coils are deactivated before the projectile reaches the center, preventing it from being pulled back and maximizing acceleration.\nPower Source The choice of power source for a coilgun depends on the desired application and performance requirements. Multiple large batteries can provide a steady supply of power for repeated firings, making them suitable for applications where rapid-fire capability is essential. Alternatively, a capacitor bank can deliver a high-voltage pulse for a single powerful shot, ideal for applications where maximum velocity is paramount. Regardless of the power source chosen, efficient energy management is essential to optimize the performance of the coilgun. Capacitor banks require careful charging and discharging mechanisms to deliver the necessary energy to each coil stage, while batteries must be capable of supplying high currents without voltage sag.\nProjectile Injection Injecting the projectile into the first coil stage is a critical step in the operation of a coilgun. A solenoid pusher is commonly used for this purpose, providing precise control over the timing and velocity of the projectile\u0026rsquo;s entry into the barrel. By activating the solenoid electrically, the projectile can be propelled into the coilgun with consistent force, ensuring reliable operation. The design of the projectile injection mechanism must account for factors such as projectile size, weight, and magnetic properties to ensure optimal performance. Additionally, safety considerations are paramount to prevent accidental firing or damage to the coilgun components.\nConclusion Coilguns, or Gauss guns, represent a fascinating intersection of electromagnetism and projectile physics. By leveraging the principles of multistage acceleration, precise switching circuitry, and efficient power management, coilguns can achieve impressive velocities and kinetic energies. As technology advances, coilguns continue to find new applications in fields such as aerospace, defense, and research. By understanding the fundamental principles and design considerations outlined in this article, engineers and enthusiasts can explore the vast potential of coilgun technology and push the boundaries of electromagnetic propulsion.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/post/coilgun/","tags":"Articles, Author: Eli Watson","title":"Making a CoilGun (Guass Rifle)"},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.es/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.fr/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.hi/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.jp/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.pl/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.ru/","tags":null,"title":""},{"categories":null,"content":"","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/search/_index.zh-cn/","tags":null,"title":""}]
