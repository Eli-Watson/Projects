## Intro 
The balisong is a pilipino knife made famous by video games and flash tricks. But how good is it for a EDC? 

## Origins of the Balisong
The balisong, also known as the Butterfly Knife, originated in the philippines as a reliable and simple utility knife. Its design consists of two handles and a blade witch rotate to open and close the blade. 

## Bali's for EDC
First of all what is EDC? EDC means Every Day Carry and refers to what knife you carry daily for utility and defense, depending on you priority's. For me it would be mostly  utility but defense is still a focus. Now the major disadvantage of a bali for edc isn't even anything about the knife itself, it is the public perception of the knife and it being regarded as a switchblade. Now since I live in Louisiana, where it is legal, this is less of a concern for me but depending where you live you might be in deep waters. So check your local laws to make sure you wont get fined or something. But back to the Bali itself. So you might be asking "What is the purpose of such a thing?" Well, it is a folding knife with the strength of a fixed blade. Also it is one of the easiest knifes, besides a auto, to deploy one handed. So if one hand is occupied then you can still open your knife and use it. 

### Bali Construction 
Balisongs are traditionally Made with either wood or bamboo as handles and may or may not feature Latches. While this is still different from the original balis which were made with whatever materials were available locally.

Modern Balis on the other hand often feature metals such as aluminum, steel, and Titanium in their construction and often feature both sandwich and milled handle construction. They often feature zen pins to flip the blade instead of more tractional tang pins, though they are still used. And balis made specificity for tricks usually don't have latches.
