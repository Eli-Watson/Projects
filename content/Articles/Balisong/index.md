## Intro 
The balisong is a philipino knife made famous by video games and flash tricks. But how good is it for a EDC? 

## Origins of the Balisong
The balisong, also known as the Butterfly Knife, originated in the phillipines as a reiable and simple utility knife. Its disign consits of two handels and a blade wich rotate to open and close the blade. 

## Bali's for EDC
First of all what is EDC? EDC means Evrey Day Carry and refers to what knife you carry daily for utility and defense, depending on you prioritys. For me it would be mostly  utility but defense is still a focus. Now the major disadvantage of a bali for edc isnt even anything about the knife itself, it is the public perceprion of the knife and it being regurded as a swich. Now since I live in Louisiana, where it is legal, this is less of a concern for me but depending where you live you migh be in deep waters. So check your local laws to make sure you wont get fined or somthing. But back to the Bali itself. So you might be asking "What is the purpose of such a thing?" Well, it is a folding knife with the streght of a fixed blade. Also it is one of the easyest knifes, besides a auto, to deploy one handed. So if one hadn is coccupied then you can still open your knife and use it. 

### Bali Construction 
Balisongs are traditonally Made with either wood or bamboo as handles and may or may not feture Latches. While this is still diffrent from the original balis wich were made with whatever mateials were avalible locally.
Heres and Example:

Modern Balis on the other hand often feature metals such as aluminum, steel, and titaniam in their constructon and often feture both sandwich and milled handle construction. They often feature zen pins to flip the blade instead of more tratinal tang pins, though they are still used. And balis made spessificly for tricks usally don't have latches.
