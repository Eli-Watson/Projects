# Tiny 11 On a Dell Latitude E4510 (and other things)

So I had this old Dell E5410 that was just sitting on a shelf collecting dust. And I had just discovered a modified version of Win11 called Tiny11. So it only seemed natural for me to try and install one on the other.
But first of all, the specs:

## Laptop Specifications

- Processor: Intel Core i5-450M
- Memory: 8GB DDR3L 1600 CL11 RAM
- Storage: 128GB SSD
- Wireless: Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6235

So with that out of the way let's get into the installation: I had no issues. It's a first for me, but this time when installing the OS it went smoothly and without hiccups, besides declining all of Microsoft's AI features.
I have linked a video I made that outlines performance testing using Cinebench 2003.
